# My-To-Do-List-Project

Hello friends :) Here, I will share my html project with MySkill.id named My To Do List project. On this project, I used html as a basic for build To Do List page, then combined it with CSS to make it prettier and also JavaScript to make the functionalities of the features inside it. On this page, you can create your own to-do list, and if you have done with your lists, you can mark them as complete then delete them. Have a nice try!
